# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a simple **Rock Paper Scissors** game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user selects either rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer randomly selects its move. The winner of each round is displayed along with updated scores for both the user and the computer.

## Features

- The computer randomly selects one of the three moves.
- The result is displayed (win, lose, or tie), along with the current score for both the user and the computer.
- The game uses images for each of the moves.
